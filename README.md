#As a user:

1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list.
2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
3. All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
4. I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
5. Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
6. I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
7. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
8. Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
9. I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
